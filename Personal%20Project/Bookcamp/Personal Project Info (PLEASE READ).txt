This is my personal project which is one third of our team project.
 The latter will be a site similar what imdb is for movies, but for
 books! It’s name is Bookcamp and it essentially is a book database,
 where users can browse our book collection, find info about them,
 as well as their authors, review/rate books and keep a personal
 wishlist with those of interest to her.

My part of the project is the book page itself. The navigation bar
 on top, as well as the bottom bar are inactive, as I’ve focused on
 the actual book content/info. Since there is no loggin function in
 my part, I’ve set a default user (the username of whom can be seen
 on top right of the page) – this can change via the index.jsp. As 
him, you can use the book page’s main functionalities just like if 
you would be logged in.

As with log in part, since the homepage is in another teammate’s
 part, I’ve set book no.1 in our database to be (my personal projects)
 temporary homepage. From there, you can navigate to other books
 either via the carousel with the current author’s other works, or
 via the url by adding     ?bookId=xx     (where xx is the id of
 the books in our database - 1 to 46 at the moment) after the
 default /index.jsp (yes, the search functionality is also a
 teammate’s work).

Feel free to check any and all of the books and ther info, add/remove
 them from your wishlist, add/update/delete your rating/review.

That’s it for now. For more awesomeness, stay tuned for the whole
 project…
